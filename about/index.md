Hello, I'm Oliver Weißl, a researcher at fortiss GmbH and a PhD candidate at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, followed by a Master's in Information Studies at the University of Amsterdam (UvA).

My research focuses on testing of Deep Learning Systems, by exploiting knowledge encoded in latent spaces. Testing plays a critical role across various domains to ensure that a systems function as intended. However, the complexity of DL models makes effective testing both more challenging and more essential.

Currently, I am exploring how latent representations in generative models can be used to test deep neural networks more effectively.
Other research interests include classical and population-based optimization, evolutionary computing, robotics, machine learning, and quantum computing.

My work experiences are:

- Researcher @ [fortiss GmbH](https://www.fortiss.org/) <span class="meta-text">[09.2024 - now)</span>
- Research Assistant @ [CI Group - VU Amsterdam](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) <span class="meta-text">[09.2023 - 04.2024]</span>
  
  - My responibilites were development of [Revolve2](https://github.com/ci-group/revolve2), a simulator geared towards evolutionary computing in the domain of robotics.
  - Assisting in scientific projects.

- Teaching Assistant @ [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en) <span class="meta-text">[04.2022 - 07.2024]</span>
