During my time as Research Assistant at the CI-Group @ VU Amsterdam, I worked with [Dr. Jie Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fqimtqwAAAAJ&hl=en) on a study investigating Lamarckian Inheritance in Modular Robots. My main contribution was replicating the simulator experiments with real robots, allowing for better understanding of behavior and sim2real gap.
You can find the preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19545).

#### Abstract:

> This study explores the integration of Lamarckian system into evolutionary robotics (ER), comparing it with the traditional Darwinian model across various environments. By adopting Lamarckian principles, where robots inherit learned traits, alongside Darwinian learning without inheritance, we investigate adaptation in dynamic settings. Our research, conducted in six distinct environmental setups, demonstrates that Lamarckian systems outperform Darwinian ones in adaptability and efficiency, particularly in challenging conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the interplay between controller \& morphological evolution and environment adaptation, with parent-offspring similarities and newborn \&survivors before and after learning providing insights into the effectiveness of trait inheritance. Our findings suggest Lamarckian principles could significantly advance autonomous system design, highlighting the potential for more adaptable and robust robotic solutions in complex, real-world applications. These theoretical insights were validated using real physical robots, bridging the gap between simulation and practical application.
