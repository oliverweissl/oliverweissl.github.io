For my MSc Thesis with the [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/), I had my first interaction with quantum computing, writing about Quantum Error Corretion (QEC).
My supervisor [Evgenii Egorov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LwVVunEAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao) offered the topic building upon his [work about Equivariant Decoders for QEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07362).
This thesis expanded upon the case of correcting on 2D toric code, to 3d toric codes. I also investigated the impact of using Transformer models in combination to equivariant CNNs.
Following from a request on my Github-Repo I decided to publish this work on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04300), to make it accessible to others.
__I`m very happy if you are giving feedback on this work as I want to improve this paper.__

### Abstract:

> Mitigating errors in computing and communication systems has seen a great deal of research since the beginning of the widespread use of these technologies. However, as we develop new methods to do computation or communication, we also need to reiterate the method used to deal with errors. Within the field of quantum computing, error correction is getting a lot of attention since errors can propagate fast and invalidate results, which makes the theoretical exponential speed increase in computation time, compared to traditional systems, obsolete. To correct errors in quantum systems, error-correcting codes are used. A subgroup of codes, topological codes, is currently the focus of many research papers. Topological codes represent parity check matrices corresponding to graphs embedded on a d-dimensional surface. For our research, the focus lies on the toric code with a 3D square lattice. The goal of any decoder is robustness to noise, which can increase with code size. However, a reasonable decoder performance scales polynomially with lattice size. As error correction is a time-sensitive operation, we propose a neural network using an inductive bias: equivariance. This allows the network to learn from a rather small subset of the exponentially growing training space of possible inputs. In addition, we investigate how transformer networks can help in correction. These methods will be compared with various configurations and previously published methods of decoding errors in the 3D toric code.
