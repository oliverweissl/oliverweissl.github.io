I worked with [Dr. Kevin Godin-Dubois](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8k1MH20AAAAJ) on realising a concept towards 'Artificial General Creatures'. This work was presented as part of the __Evolution of Things__ workshop at [ALife2024](https://2024.alife.org/).
My main contributions were to implement hardware access on the physical modular robots to transfer the learned controller from simulation to reality.

### Abstract:

> We introduce here the concept of Artificial General Creatures (AGC) which encompasses "robotic or virtual agents with a wide enough range of capabilities to ensure their continued survival". With this in mind, we propose a research line aimed at incrementally building both the technology and the trustworthiness of AGC. The core element in this approach is that trust can only be built over time, through demonstrably mutually beneficial interactions.
To this end, we advocate starting from unobtrusive, nonthreatening artificial agents that would explicitly collaborate with humans, similarly to what domestic animals do. By combining multiple research fields, from Evolutionary Robotics to Neuroscience, from Ethics to Human-Machine Interaction, we aim at creating embodied, self-sustaining Artificial General Creatures that would form social and emotional connections with humans. Although they would not be able to play competitive online games or generate poems, we argue that creatures akin to artificial pets would be invaluable stepping stones toward symbiotic Artificial General Intelligence.
